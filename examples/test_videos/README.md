ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=10:size=1280x720:rate=30 \
       -pix_fmt yuv420p test_pattern.mp4

# Add text overlay
ffmpeg -i test_pattern.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Test Video':x=10:y=10:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" \
       test_video_with_text.mp4
```

## Example Filenames

Use descriptive filenames for easy identification:

```
