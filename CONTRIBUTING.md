## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with Cortex AI
- ACCOUNTADMIN or equivalent privileges
- Familiarity with SQL and Python
- Understanding of Streamlit framework

### Local Development (Optional)

For local testing of Streamlit components:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd video-intelligence-demo

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Snowflake credentials
# Create a .env file with:
# SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=<your_account>
# SNOWFLAKE_USER=<your_user>
# SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<your_password>
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### SQL Code

```sql
-- Use uppercase for keywords
SELECT 
    column_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM table_name
WHERE condition = TRUE
GROUP BY column_name
ORDER BY total_count DESC;

-- Add comments for complex logic
-- Descriptive naming conventions
-- Consistent indentation (4 spaces)
```

### Python Code

```python
# Follow PEP 8 style guide
# Use type hints where applicable
# Add docstrings to functions

def analyze_video(video_id: str, question: str) -> str:
    """
    Analyze video using Cortex AI.
    
    Args:
        video_id: Unique identifier for the video
        question: Natural language question about the video
        
    Returns:
        Analysis result as a string
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Streamlit UI

- Use descriptive variable names
- Add helpful tooltips and help text
